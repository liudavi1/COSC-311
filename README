Please give me, the original creator credit, other than that this is a free program for use. 
This project was finished under Dr.Dirk Colbry, at the CMSE department at Michigan State University. 
It was a final project for a independent study.
You need to replace blanks within the code with a ABS file and a PPM image file before use. 
To run this program, you need to replace the blank string with your ABS file name in readABS().
You also need to replace the blank string with your image file name in img.imread().
On the code there is a portion that needs to change based on the abs file involved,
face = FRGC.readABS()
im = misc.imresize(img.imread(),200)/256
FRGC.showFace(face, im)
the 200 from the 200/256 needs to change based on abe file. 
Otherwise the image will not work correctly. It directly affects the image color.
