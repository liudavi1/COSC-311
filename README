This project was finished under Dr.Dirk Colbry, at the CMSE department at Michigan State University. 
It was a final project for a independent study.
You need to replace blanks within the code with a ABS file and a PPM image file before use. 
To run this program, you need to replace the blank string with your ABS file name in readABS().
you also need to replace the blank string with your image file name in img.imread().
